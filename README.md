# Hi there, I'm Jose Manuel 👋

I'm a Data Analyst who is passionate about making open-source more accessible and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include R and Python. My interest in knowledge-sharing led me to launch <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Quarantine-HUB-100133491701774">Quarantine Hub</a>, a community for Data Scientist.
